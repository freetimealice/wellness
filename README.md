Inspired by the classic game Whack-a-Mole, Punchabug is an augmented reality web game where a player uses their nose to "punch" virtual bugs off their leaves to earn points. The player can choose from three difficulty levels, each with unique features, such as obstacles to avoid.

In building Punchabug, we used Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, React, React-Redux and Posenet, a pre-trained machine learning model that detects key points on the user's body via their device's webcam. We utilized the react lifecycle to implement augmented reality components that respond to user interaction. We focused on user experience, incorporating feedback from test users. Features include giving the user a combined visual and auditory response to their actions, increasing game complexity at higher levels, and displaying a persistent leaderboard for high scorers.
